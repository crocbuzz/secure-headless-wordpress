# Headless WordPress Base

A secure, pre-configured base setup for running WordPress completely headless

## Usage

Make sure you install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) first.

Then run `composer install` in the site directory to install the depenendencies. As of this writing, it's just a single one that helps to make a WordPress site more secure and manageable.

Next, duplicate the `.env.example` file in the site directory and rename it to `.env`. 

Open this file in your text editor of choice and fill in the appropriate values.
